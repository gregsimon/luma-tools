# Privacy Policy for Luma Tools
Last updated: December 20, 2025

Luma Tools ("we", "our", or "the app") is a web-based tool designed to help users manage samples for the Luma-1 and Luma-Mu drum machines. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data.

## 1. Data Collection and Storage
Luma Tools is a "client-side" application. This means almost all processing and data storage happen directly in your web browser. We do not operate a backend server that stores your sound files, personal information, or credentials.

## 2. Google Drive Integration
Luma Tools provides optional integration with Google Drive to allow you to save and load your sound files.

*   **Access:** The app requests permission to access your Google Drive (specifically the `drive.file` and `drive.readonly` scopes).
*   **Folder Usage:** The app creates and interacts with a specific folder named `luma1_sounds` to keep your files organized.
*   **Data Handling:** When you upload or download files via Google Drive, the data is transmitted directly between your browser and Google's servers. We never see, store, or intercept your Google Drive files or your Google account credentials.

## 3. Third-Party Services
We use the following third-party services:
*   **Firebase Authentication:** To handle the secure login process via Google. Firebase manages the authentication tokens; Luma Tools does not store your password.
*   **Google Drive API:** To provide the cloud storage functionality.

## 4. No Data Sharing
We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information or sound data to outside parties. Your data remains under your control at all times.

## 5. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

## 6. Contact Us
